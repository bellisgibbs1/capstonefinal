  <h1> As Fewer Young Americans Say They Believe in God, a Look at Why So Many Have Abandoned Religion and What Motivates Others to Keep the Faith </h1>

  <h2> Written and Photographed by Briana Ellis-Gibbs </h2>


        
          <p>Jalesha Bass, 23, a graduate student at Union Theological Seminary in Harlem,  remembers during her senior year at The University of Texas at Austin in April 2020 during the beginning stages of the COVID pandemic, she and her friends, including a stripper and a self-proclaimed witch, were inside her apartment when they had an unexpected debate about religion and God.
          </p>

          <p>Bass says her friends came to her with their questions about God and religion because they knew she was religious, but she herself didn’t know the answers to some of the questions they were asking, so they all worked together to find the answers.  
          </p>
          
    

          <p>She recounts how she and her friends during quarantine questioned their religious beliefs.  “We just ended up having like this random argument about religion and God, and they were just like, Jalesha, you know the Bible, so come explain this to us, or whatever, and I'm like, baby, I don't know the answer to the questions y'all asking either, but we can whip out the Bible, and we can figure this out together,” she says. “We were like Google searching and stuff like I tried my best to facilitate conversation.” 
          </p>

         <p>She believes that the pandemic led to many of her friends questioning their beliefs. Her friends were asking her questions like “if I die what'll happen? Where will I go?” she says.</p>

        <p>As we move into a cultural shift after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Generation Zers and Millennials have been wrestling with their belief in God. 34 percent of Generation Zers do not affiliate with religion in comparison to 29 percent of millennials and 25 percent of Generation X who are not religious according to a report done by The American Survey Center.  The age range for millennials and generation Z ranges from 10 years old to 41 years old. Overall, Americans' belief in God has hit an all-time low, from nearly 90 percent in 2017 to 81 percent this year according to a new poll by Axios. 
        </p>

        <p>A generational shift in parenting style may help explain why so few young people say they believe in God. Many modern parents feel reluctant to force the religious practices they were raised with onto their children. “There's less of a kind of generational transmission of religious belief and practice from parents to children than there once was,” says Brian Steensland, the chair of the sociology department at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. 
        </p>

        <p>“Parents think that children should make up their own minds about their religious lives or whether they are religious, or what kind of religion they practice or beliefs they hold,” he says.</p>

<p>Lucian Kouros,19, who attends Brooklyn College, left the religion of his family and does not plan to ever attend a place of worship again. Kouros’s grandmother is Christian, and  his mother brought him to church until he was 7 years old, but then he has stopped attending. 
</p>

<p>He says his grandmother who is 80 years old is indifferent when it comes to whether or not he should attend church. “She doesn't care too much,” he says. “She only just does it for herself. She doesn't mind if other people do or don't do it.”
</p>

<p>Would Kouros ever attend a place of worship, again, he says probably not. He instead uses drawing and listening to music as a way to stay at peace. "They'd have to give me a pretty interesting reason because, I mean, I still don't think I would go,” he explains. “I can't be so regimented and only this book; this is what I judged my life on and my decisions off of. I'm kind of more open-minded than that.”  
</p>

<p>There is now a sharp decline of people leaving Christianity. A study done by Pew Research suggests that Christians will make up less than half of the US population by 2070. Their projections showed that the number of people who are Christians will shrink from 64% to 54% by 2027. Instead of joining traditional religions like Christianity, many young people have started to adopt alternative religions like Buddhism. Buddhism is expected to grow from almost 4 million in 2010 to 6.1 million by 2050 in the United States according to pew research.

  Methulia Medage,13, finds peace when practicing Buddhism while attending her temple, New York Buddhist Vihara in Queens Village, NY.  "Buddhism has introduced ways to help me maintain my anger and any other emotions that might jump out or actions or speech that I might regret saying," she says. </p>
  
 <p>Medage, who attends the middle school, MS 158Q in Queens, NYC, will never believe in God as she feels like there is no supernatural more powerful than humans. “There is no God that is more powerful than me. Everybody is sort of equal in a way, but in Buddhism, we follow one teacher, not God, and he's the Buddha and he's a human, just like all of us, but he's a more advanced human, not a whole God,” she says. “I feel like I wouldn't really believe in God because it makes us feel inferior.”
 </p>


 <p>When asked why her peers have moved away from traditional religion she suggests it may be because of social media. "Some people may be driven by maybe outside influences like social media or what they hear outside. Some people just may simply become bored or feel like they shouldn't be forced to learn about something,” she says. </p>

<p>Zach Williams, 34, who is now an atheist after being a former worship pastor in Montana, agrees with Medage that technology is the reason why people are leaving religion, as it was part of the reason why he left the church. Williams is originally from Tennessee and comes from a religious family, his grandfather is a pastor. He believes his family's religious views come from their lack of technology growing up. 
</p>

<p>Growing up, he did not have a cell phone until high school, and he did not have access to technology which he says provided people with limited opportunities to learn things outside of what was already known. 
</p>

<p>“I grew up on the cusp where I didn't have a cell phone until I was in high school, and we didn't have the internet when I was growing up. So I remember sitting at dinners and people asking questions and somebody says the answer, and then that was it. But now if somebody asks a question, they can look it up on a search engine, and they can have millions of different answers at their fingertips in no time”, he says. “Growing up in school, I remember them saying that the best references for getting more knowledge are books because that's where the truth lies in the books and for a lot of religious people, that book is the Bible.”
</p>

<p>As he began to gain more access to technology and meet new people, he realized he disagreed with the values and beliefs upheld by the church. Like him, he believes young people are leaving because they now have access to many more tools than books to find out information. “I think that a lot of people are leaving just because there are alternatives to that one source (the bible),” he says.

<p>Even though technology may be one of the reasons that young people are leaving traditional religion, it has led some young adults to their faith. Alexander Ocasio, 19, a sophomore at Brooklyn College and the president of Brooklyn College’s Catholic Club, joined in conversations and debates in chat rooms when he was deciding whether he wanted to be a Catholic or Protestant. Growing up, Ocasio lived in a household where Catholicism was the primary religion although his family is not very religious. The debates and conversations he saw online solidified his belief in Catholicism.
</p>




<p>He wants to encourage other young people to follow the Catholic faith by becoming a Catholic high school teacher, but his parents are unsure about his decisions.  "I'm interested in being a high school religion teacher. So, when I told my parents that I wanted to be a religion teacher at a Catholic high school, my mom was like the school brainwashed you and all that. Even though they themselves are Catholic, they think that being devout is like some result of brainwashing of some sort," he says. "But ironically enough, my high school wasn't that devout in the first place. So that's why I want to be a religion teacher in the first place. I feel like it needs that devotion, so it needs someone to bring that devotion back."
</p>

<p>Even with many of his peers leaving traditional religion and having parents who are not always in agreement with his religious views, Ocasio has kept his faith. "I don't think what other people do or say affects [my religion] because even if 99% of the world doesn't believe in gravity, it doesn't change the fact that gravity exists. Catholicism is true, it doesn't change based on if other people believe it is or not," he says. 
</p>



<p>Yahya Abdul-Basser, a 24-year-old Muslim who works at a clinical lab in Long Island, faith brings him structure and purpose each day, and claims that a lot of the wrongdoing in the world is happening because many people lack that sense of purpose. "I think one of the most important impactful things about being Muslim… is the sense of purpose that it gives your life. And I feel like a lot of people, for a lot of different reasons, a lot of things that are very wrong, very twisted, very sick with our society are missing purpose," he says.

<p>Williams disagrees with Abdul-Basser, he says that the idea that someone has a divine purpose is all made up. “I don't think that anyone has a purpose and whatever the overall purpose that you think you have that's all made up and that's all based on the individual person, whatever your purpose, whatever you want it to be, that can be your purpose. You can find joy and enrichment in lots of things in life without having to call it a purpose,” he says.
</p>

<p>Williams has always found joy and peace in music. When he was a pastor in Montana he led the music ministry at his church, he saw how heavily churches rely on music to form the church community. “Church, music, and people are all heavily related. Almost every religion that I can think of really revolves heavily around music,” he says. Humans by nature are very drawn to music and most people enjoy music and have some sort of an emotional connection to it.”
</p>



<p>He also relied on music to find his own community outside of the church. Whenever he moved with his now ex-wife, a traveling physician who divorced him because they no longer shared the same religious beliefs, he would find a Bluegrass music group never further than an hour from where he lived. He said the group would help bring him community and has continued joining groups even after leaving the church. 
</p>

<p>“The nice thing with Bluegrass Music specifically, if you don't know anything about it’s a rule form of country music where the main thing is hanging out together. So the main thing with bluegrass is everybody bringing their instruments, sitting in a circle, and playing songs together and just kind of communicating through music in a circle,” he says.
</p>

<p>Bluegrass music came out of the rural south after World War II. To play Bluegrass music, people sit in a circle and one person leads a song of their choice with their instrument and the others in the circle must follow with their instruments, and it keeps repeating until the circle ends. 
 
</p>



<p>Williams uses music to connect with his ancestors who hold different religious views than him. “I've played my grandpa's guitar and one day I hope to own it. So every time I play I feel connected to him. My grandmother used to sing me songs sitting on her front porch. So anytime I sing those songs, I feel connected to her. Since my mom passed, anytime there's a song that reminds me of her, or it's her favorite artist [playing] I feel connected to her. So there's definitely a thread of music throughout my life, and I assume most everyone's life,” he says. </p>

<p>Williams has not told his family about leaving their religion, and when he does he hopes they see that he and his family are not that different at all. “I haven't changed as a person. I'm not a bad person. I'm not doing bad things, and I'm still the person that they think I am. I just believe in one less God than they do,” he says.
